## MechHisui.SecretHitler

Based on the [2016 board game "Secret Hitler"](http://secrethitler.com/)
by Mike Boxleiter, Tommy Maranges, Max Temkin, and Mac Shubert,
this library brings the satirical game of early 1930's Germany politics to Discord.
Find fellow Liberals to stop the lying Fascists, or use clever deceit and put Hitler into power.

For an extra twist, you can change the "theme" of the game to anything that could fit the core gameplay. ("Secret Palpatine", anyone?)

This library is powered by [Discord.Addons.MpGame](https://github.com/Joe4evr/Discord.Addons/tree/master/src/Discord.Addons.MpGame)
and also serves as an extended example of the functionality of the `MpGame` library.
